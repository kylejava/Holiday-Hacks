## Inspiration

We wanted to build something fun and unique for this hackathon. Since the theme was Christmas themed, we thought it would be a great idea to create something around the music of Christmas. We wanted to build a little music box that would play classic Christmas songs, as well as show it in a visually pleasing way.

## What it does

The Arduin-Ho-Ho-Ho Music Box is a small device that plays music through an attached speaker. The user will press the button on the breadboard and the music box will play a Christmas song and when it does different lights will turn on on the breadboard according to which note it is on.

## How we built it

We built the music box using an Arduino. We were able to play the sounds using a buzzer. The notes were displayed using 8 LED lights, each light corresponding to Christmas colors. We added a button for the user to press in order to activate the music box. We attached everything and routed the wires through a breadboard. In order to play different notes, we used Arduino code (C++) to program it, as well as used other Arduino packages.

## Challenges we ran into

It was difficult in implementing a way to hold the note, because each note played for the same duration, so it was hard creating a rhythm for the music box. It was also difficult to create the box itself, we had to do a lot of calculations and measurements so everything could route together and so we could wrap the box with wrapping paper.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of being able to create rhythm for the music box, that way it wasn't just a constant collection of random noises that user's won't be able to recognize when they hear the song. Creating a hardware hack in general, it was my team's first creating a hardware hack and we did not have that many supplies with us, so we were happy that we accomplished with what we had.

## What we learned

We learned more about how to use other tools that could work with the Arduino, like how to use LED lights and how the buzzer works. We also learned how to use Arduino Code (C++).

## What's next for Arduin-Ho-Ho-Ho Music Box

The implementation of more songs in the music box. A way to play more notes at one time, because at the moment it can only play one at a time. We were thinking of adding another speaker to the breadboard and playing two speakers at the same time, that way we can play chords instead of just single notes.
